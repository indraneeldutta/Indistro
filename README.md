Papyros Shell is the desktop shell for Papyros, an operating system based upon Linux which conforms to Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. The focus will be on creating a stable and easy-to-use operating system with a heavy emphasis on well-thought-out design.

Brought to you by the [Papyros development team](https://github.com/papyros/papyros-shell/graphs/contributors).

### Implementation Details ###

The shell is built as a compositor for Wayland using the Green Island compositor framework and QtQuick. The goal is to develop a convergent shell that adapts to the form factor of the device it is running on, and to also support HIDPI screens.

Green Island provides the C++ code necessary to interact with Wayland, and QML Desktop provides C++ plugins for QML for the desktop indicators, so the majority of the shell is implemented in QML and Javascript.

Special thanks to Hawaii shell and its author Pier Luigi Fiorini for some of the QML backend plugins, including the hardware plugin and the original code for the app launcher model.

### Installing on Arch ###

Papyros has an Arch repository with binary packages of Papyros shell and necessary dependencies, along with some other Material Design apps. Instructions are available [here](http://papyros.io/download/index.html).

### Dependencies ###

 * Qt 5.5 (including QtWayland)
 * Wayland
 * [GreenIsland](https://github.com/greenisland/greenisland)
 * [QML Material](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) (the `develop` branch).
 * [QT5XDG](https://github.com/lxde/libqtxdg) for desktop file parsing
 * PAM for authentication
 * Several KDE Frameworks
   * [KConfig](http://api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/kconfig/html/)
   * [KDeclarative](http://api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/kdeclarative/html/)
   * [Solid](http://api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/solid/html/)
   * [NetworkManagerQt](http://api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/networkmanager-qt/html/)
   * [ModemManagerQt](http://api.kde.org/frameworks-api/frameworks5-apidocs/modemmanager-qt/html/) (optional)
 * ALSA or PulseAudio for the sound indicator

### Installation ###

Once the necessary dependencies are installed, you can build and install the Papyros shell as follows:

    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DQML_INSTALL_DIR=lib/qt/qml
    make && sudo make install

### Running the shell ###

To run the shell from an existing desktop environment as a windowed shell or from a virtual terminal as a full Wayland compositor, run:

    papyros-session

### Using the SDDM theme ###

The SDDM theme for Papyros is installed along with the shell. To set it as the current theme, edit the `/etc/sddm.conf` file and edit the `Current` key under the `[Theme]` group to match:

    [Theme]
    # Current theme name
    Current=papyros

Now restart your computer and enjoy the new theme!
